# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis Using Python

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior to identify patterns that lead customers to discontinue services.  
The goal is to understand which customer segments are most likely to churn and what business factors influence retention.

The analysis follows a structured analytics workflow:
- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Customer behavior analysis  
- Visual insight generation  
- Business recommendations  

This project demonstrates how data analysis can support customer retention strategies and data-driven business decisions.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Univariate Analysis
To understand individual variables:
- Churn distribution  
- Tenure distribution  
- Monthly charges distribution  
- Contract type distribution  
- Gender distribution  

This helped understand the overall customer base.

---

### Bivariate Analysis
To understand relationships with churn:
- Contract type vs churn  
- Tenure vs churn  
- Monthly charges vs churn  
- Payment method vs churn  

These analyses highlighted which factors are strongly linked to customer churn.

---

### Multivariate Analysis
To examine combined impact of variables:
- Tenure + Monthly Charges + Churn  

This helped identify high-risk customer groups based on multiple factors.

---

### Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap was used to analyze relationships between numerical variables such as:
- Tenure  
- Monthly charges  
- Total charges  

This helps understand how variables influence each other and churn behavior.

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn  
- Customers with low tenure are more likely to churn  
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability  
- Long-term contract customers show strong retention  
- Electronic check users have higher churn  
- High-risk segment: low tenure + high monthly charges + short contracts  

These insights highlight the importance of early customer engagement and pricing balance.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts through incentives  
- Improve onboarding for new customers  
- Provide better support for high-charge customers  
- Promote automatic payment methods  
- Identify high-risk customers early  
- Focus retention strategies on first-year customers  

These steps can help reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.

## 📌 Project Outcome
This project demonstrates how structured data analysis can:
- Identify churn drivers  
- Understand customer behavior  
- Support retention strategies  
- Enable data-driven decision making  

It reflects practical skills in:
- Data cleaning  
- Visualization  
- Insight generation  
- Business interpretation
